So, here's how this works. 

I filled out Trump's media accountability "survey" in a way that's favorable to
CNN, MSNBC, the NYTimes, and the Washington Post, and unfavorable to Fox and Trump's attacks on the media.

I recorded the payload from this form submission, and used it as the template for answering these questions.

After installing this plugin, visit the [survey page](https://action.donaldjtrump.com/mainstream-media-accountability-survey/).

The extension will generate a random first name, last name, zip code, and e-mail address.
It will then submit the form in the background, and refresh the page, which will trigger it to start over again.

## Installation

1. In chrome://extensions, check the "developer mode" checkbox to enable developer extensions.
2. Drag and drop the "dist" folder to chrome://extensions.
3. Visit the [survey page](https://action.donaldjtrump.com/mainstream-media-accountability-survey/).
4. Profit :-)
