So, here's how this works. 

I filled out Trump's one month approval survey in a way that disapproves of everything he's done.
I recorded the payload from these answers and used it to construct the payload for this plugin.

## Installation

1. In chrome://extensions, check the "developer mode" checkbox to enable developer extensions.
2. Drag and drop the "dist" folder to chrome://extensions.
3. Visit the [survey page](https://gop.com/trump-first-month-approval-survey).
4. Profit :-)

## Contributing

1. Fork, Pull forked repo, create new branch. (blah, blah)
2. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).
3. Change to project directory.
4. Install dependencies: `yarn install`.
5. Make modifications in `src/`.
6. Build changes: `grunt`.

Test, git push, and open PR :-) (thanks for your contribution!)
